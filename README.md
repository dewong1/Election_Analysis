# Election_Analysis
Performing analysis on Election data to determine Election Results 


## Overview of Election Audit 

Given an Excel dataspreadsheet with Colorado election results, the purpose of this election audit analysis was to create a Python script that will deliver the following information when the script is run: 1) *Total number of votes cast*, 2) *Complete list of candidates who received votes*, 3) *Total number of votes each candidate recevied*, 4) *Percentage of votes each candidate won*, and 5) *The winner of the election based on popular vote*. The Excel dataspreadsheet included three columns: Ballot ID, County (Jefferson, Denver, & Arapahoe), and Candidate (Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, & Raymon Anthony Doane)
